# Static Routing – Packet Tracer Lab

## 📌 Objective
To understand how static routing works by manually configuring routes
between two routers.

## 🧠 What is Static Routing?
Static routing is a method where routes are manually configured
by a network administrator. It is suitable for small and predictable networks.

## 🗺️ Network Topology
- Two routers connected using a point-to-point link
- Each router has one LAN
- Static routes are configured for remote networks

## 🌐 IP Addressing
### R1
- LAN: 192.168.1.1/24
- WAN: 10.0.0.1/30

### R2
- LAN: 192.168.2.1/24
- WAN: 10.0.0.2/30

## ⚙️ Static Route Configuration
Example static route command:
